I want to build an online grocery shopping agent using strands. He should be able to 
1. Ingest a JSON file representing my shopping cart or an MD file - we can talk about this later
1. Visit heb.com and select my store from the list
3. Purchase all of the items on the list, notifiying me if he needs to make substitutions
4. He should not purchase meat from the butcher because I like to go look at it myself (other meat is fine)
5. His final result should be everything added to cart for me to review.
